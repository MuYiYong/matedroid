# Fix GitHub Issue Skill

Fix a GitHub issue following the complete workflow from investigation to merge.

## Arguments

The skill expects a GitHub issue number as argument:
```
/fix 123
```

If no argument is provided, ask the user for the issue number.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the Issue

The repository is called `matedroid` and it is owned by `vide`.

Use `mcp__github__issue_read` to get the issue details:
- Issue title and description
- Any existing comments
- Labels and assignees
- References to other issues, noted by the #123 format.

**Important**: Note the language the issue was written in. You will use this language for all interactions on the issue itself.

### 2. Investigate the Problem

Before writing any code:
1. Understand the issue completely
2. Search the codebase for relevant files using Glob and Grep
3. Read the relevant source files
4. If anything is unclear, add a comment to the issue asking for clarification (in the issue's original language)

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for the fix:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

Example: `fix/issue-42-dashboard-crash`

### 4. Apply the Fix

Edit the necessary files to fix the issue. Follow these principles:
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the issue
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Add comments only where the logic isn't self-evident
- All code comments MUST be in English

At the end of the fixing process, ALWAYS update the CHANGELOG.md file with a short description of the fix and the related issue number.

### 5. Run Tests Locally

Run the test suite to verify the fix doesn't break anything:
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

Fix any test failures before proceeding.

### 6. Commit and Push

Commit with a semantic commit message:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: <description of fix> (#<issue-number>)"
git push -u origin fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

### 7. Create Pull Request

Use `mcp__github__create_pull_request` to create a PR:
- **Title**: Same as the commit message (e.g., `fix: resolve dashboard crash (#42)`)
- **Body**: Must be in English and include:
  - Summary of the problem
  - Explanation of the fix
  - Reference to the issue: `Fixes #<issue-number>`
  - Test plan

Example PR body:
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what was fixed.

Fixes #42

## Root Cause
Explanation of why the bug occurred.

## Solution
What changes were made to fix it.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Manual testing steps
- [ ] Unit tests pass

```

### 8. Wait for CI

Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow:
```bash
gh run list --limit 5
gh run watch
```

If CI fails:
1. Read the failure logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
2. Fix the issues locally
3. Commit and push the fixes
4. Wait for CI again

Do NOT proceed to merge until all checks pass.

### 9. Add Issue Comment

Once the PR is created, add a comment to the original issue (in the issue's original language) letting the reporter know a fix is in progress:
- Link to the PR
- Brief explanation of what was done

### 10. Merge the PR

Once CI passes, merge the PR:
```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

Or use `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` with `merge_method: "squash"`.

### 11. Confirm Closure

Verify the issue was automatically closed by the `Fixes #<number>` reference. If not, close it manually and add a final comment (in the issue's original language) confirming the fix is released.

## Language Rules

| Context | Language |
|---------|----------|
| Issue comments | Same language as the original issue |
| Questions to clarify the issue | Same language as the original issue |
| Code comments | English |
| Commit messages | English |
| PR title and body | English |
| Code review responses | English |

## Error Handling

- If the issue cannot be reproduced, comment on the issue asking for more details
- If the fix requires breaking changes, discuss in the issue before proceeding
- If tests cannot pass due to unrelated failures, note this and ask the user how to proceed
